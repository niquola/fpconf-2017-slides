# FPCONF 2017


## Informational Revolution / Infosphere

* infosphere
* noosphere
* cyberspace

## We are creating informational subsystems

* transmit & transform, store & query data


## Information driven situated programming

* https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/EffectivePrograms.md


## Open world assumption

* Is what we do not know correct?
* Information Loss / All types/classes etc

## Ontology

* classification problem (mulitple)
* intensive vs extensive ontology (add-hoc poly)

> don't allow the schemas to dominate the semantics

* Bosch img


## Data

* data + semanitic = information
* data interoperability
* data composability

Data survive your code

## FP vs TP

Stop mixing it!

* scandal of deduction
* prof is not value, just quality
* Chemistry & Math


## Clojure

We programm with pure 
functions and data, so the 
language extremely small and simple

* Prefer data over code
* Prefer functions over macros
* Prefer fp over tp

* Small codebases
* Composability
* Occam's razor
